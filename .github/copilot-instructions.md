# ML Audio Restoration Project

This project uses deep learning to restore and enhance audio from 78rpm records with stereo separation capabilities.

## Project Structure
- `data/` - Training and test audio samples
- `models/` - Saved model checkpoints
- `src/` - Source code for models, training, and inference
- `config/` - Configuration files

## Key Features
- Audio denoising for 78rpm records
- Crackle and pop removal
- Mono-to-stereo conversion using AI
- Audio enhancement and restoration

## Development Guidelines
- Use PyTorch for deep learning models
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Keep audio processing utilities modular
- Document model architectures clearly
